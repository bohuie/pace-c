# Meeting Minutes - October 9

## Agenda Items:
- Housekeeping stuff
- Review prototypes
- [JP]: Clarify the difference between account registration and sign up form (from technical requirements, it seems they're not the same).
- Clarify that the weekly report is due on Wednesday (PST) and that the prototype should be done before Tuesday (PST)
- Clarify the process for a user to create their account (when to ask them to fillout the mentee/mentor form)

## Detailed Notes:
- Form lives on website or is shared by email. Both mentors and mentees can fill this form. 
- For mentor: you have to fill out the form and then you can register an account on the mentorship portal
- For mentee: you fill out the form and then you can, if you want to, go to mentorship portal and register an account. If you don't register account then you will get an email directly when a mentor chooses to mentor you.
- Team meeting on monday
- Finish prototype video

## Action Items:
- JP will tell each member what is needed for the video
