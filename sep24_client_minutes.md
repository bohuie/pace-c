###NOTES
●	Shannon attended UBCO and completed her Capstone Project five years ago. She is currently working for Pace, which uses machine learning and AI to create dynamic pricing for hostels to generate higher revenue. 
●	Meetings will be held Tuesdays from 9-10AM(PST) over Zoom. 
●	Notes to be collaborated on with Pace A and Pace B (such as establishing initial system requirements) will be on a public Google Doc.
●	The premise for the project is to create a web application for both organizations and non-profits to connect mentors with mentees.
●	This system should be flexible in the way that smaller non-profits can share the form publicly, whereas large organizations (Such as Google) can host the system internally (using validation through means such as corporate email addresses)
●	There are two main components for the project:
1)	The Mentor and Mentee Sign-Up Form
■	This will be a general iframe form which can be embedded into a website.
■	The goal is to collect information on users (i.e Mentor vs Mentee, skills, availability)
2)	The Login System for Mentors and Mentees
■	Mentees should be able to pair with mentors and view a calendar for Mentor availability (Front-end web development).
●	There is nothing too specific for how the website should look, the styling is essentially up to us.
