# EIGHTEENTH CLIENT MEETING 03/3

## 3 MARCH 2021 / 12:00PM / VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

2/24-01. Obtain consent from the team on whether they're comfortable if Codebar decides to fork our repo after April **Complete**

2/24-02. Replace Alerts with Ant Design's Notifications **Complete**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Conduct "Stand Up".

- Our Github project board will be displayed to show what we're planning on accomplishing during the upcoming sprint (likely incorporating feedback from the peer testing sessions and fixing bugs). Our application will be run to demonstrate the modifications to the application in the past week (fixes to routing, notifications rather than alerts, etc).

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- Due to the course requiring peer testing, development slowed.
