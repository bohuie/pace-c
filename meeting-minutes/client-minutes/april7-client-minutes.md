### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

3/17-02. Prohibit Mentor Form submission unless the user was requested **To be noted in final documentation**
3/24-01. Mention in the final report that the GET request URLs are on localhost, and that these would need to be updated if the site is deployed.**To be noted in final documentation**
3/24/02. Within step-by-step-guide.md, ensure that everything under the heading 'Maintenance Issues' has been written in a general way so that anyone who decides to use our codebase can create a Firebase/gmail account and know what needs to be updated in our code for it to work. **To be noted in final documentation**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Conduct "Stand Up".

- Our Github project board will be displayed to show what we're planning on accomplishing during the upcoming sprint. Our application will be running in case the client wants to see a demo of anything on our application (although features requiring the backend will not be available due to security upgrades).

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- No major road blocks stand out. The team is working towards wrapping up the term.

3. Is there anything else that we should take into account for handover from the client's perspective?

- I'll mention that she'll be ranking the final deliverable
