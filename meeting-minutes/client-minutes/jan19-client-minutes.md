# THIRTEENTH CLIENT MEETING 01/19

## 19 JANUARY 2021 / 9:00AM/ VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

- 11/10-03. The team should discuss possible ways of obtaining Mentor availability to send to an accepted Mentee, where the Mentee can then book a slot from the Mentor's available time slots. **Hopefully due for next wednesday**
- 11/10-05. Research how a React component can be generated into an iFrame tag. **Hopefully due for next wednesday**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Conduct "Stand Up".

- Our Github project board will be dispayed at this time to showcase that in the lask week our team has been working on testing all of our React components. The application will also be run to showcase the work that was done over the winter break (primarily changes to formatting on the forms and UI).

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- Due to the final exam period and the holidays, development on the application slowed last month.
- The course requires unit testing, so we wanted to ensure that the app was functioning as expected before furthering development.

3. Inform the client of semester logistics.

- Reading Break is Feb. 15 - 19.
- Peer Testing sessions will occur Feb 22-26, so development might slow during that week.
- April 9 is our last day of the term.

4. Inquire about the Client Review (from the Canvas message, it sounds like the instructor has looked into this and that the client will be re-submitting the reviews. The client might mention this as well)
