# PACE GROUP C
# THIRD CLIENT MEETING 10/6

## 6 OCTOBER 2020 / 9:00-9:45 AM (PST) / VIA ZOOM

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING
- 09/29-01. Aleks and Eric will the modify the prototype to incorporate the following changes:
    - Instead of the skills being a checkbox, make it a ranking system. 
    - On the mentorship portal, ensure that thereâ€™s options to login, create an account, and register an organization (which also entails that the user creates an account to become an admin). 
        - Show the UI for each of those pages. 
    - This should be done by the end of the Scrum Sprint. **In progress** 
- 09/29-02. When we create the form, we can create it to be static first, and then modify it to be dynamic later on. This should be completed before the first peer testing milestone. **Definitive Date will be determined once we know when we can start programming**
- 09/29-03. Team members should think of a name for the website (currently dubbed as the "Mentorship Portal"). **In progress. Should be completed by October 13**

#### NEW BUSINESS
1.  Send the client the team Trello board.
    - Ask if it's ok if the client refers to the team's Project Board on Github rather than using Trello. 
2. Do "stand-up" for the week
    - State that we've been finalizing system requirements for the milestones 
    - Send Google Slides Presentation if ready so that the client can look over what we've worked on.
    - State that the plan for the week is to submit the requirements slides and video documents. Then the course requires all teams to view each other's videos, so we'll be spending at least 4 hours on completing course specific tasks. The rest of the week will be for members to familiarize themselves with the tech stack. 
    - Hopefully by early next week programming will begin, so by the end of October we should have something to demonstrate. 
2. Clarify how organizations register.
    - How do they find the site (Word of Mouth)?
    - Does the organization need a separate account, or is it vicariously through the admin? (For example, does Girls in Tech need their own account, or would someone from Girls in Tech go to the Mentorship Portal, click "Register Organization", enter which organization they're from, and information about themselves to create an account. That person would then be the admin.) 
3. Clarify the functionality for Admins. 
    - Do they just need to be able to view mentor and mentee information, as well as approve mentors?
