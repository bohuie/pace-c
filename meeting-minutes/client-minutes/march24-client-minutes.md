# PACE GROUP C

# TWENTIETH CLIENT MEETING 03/24

## 24 MARCH 2021 / 12PM / VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

3/17-01. Incorporate minor modifications to the 'Manage Mentors' tab per the client's suggestions **To do**
3/17-02. Prohibit Mentor Form submission unless the user was requested **To do**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Conduct "Stand Up".

- Our Github project board will be displayed to show what we're planning on accomplishing during the upcoming sprint. Our application will be running, however, since there were no major changes to the UI from the last sprint, there won't be anything to explicitly show the client (unless she requests to see something).

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- Further clarification from the client on the two following points would be beneficial:
  - In regards to backend security: a) Is there a specific API that the client recommends? b) If we decide to disable CORS apart from our domain, is that acceptable?
  - Back in October, we briefly mentioned 'unmatching', but this seemed to be an aside to our discussion while we learnt the scope of the project. A proposed solution for this was external of the application itself, as we talked about how Mentors could reflect their calendars accordingly (i.e re-opening the calendar event so it can be booked by another Mentee). Is this still the case?
