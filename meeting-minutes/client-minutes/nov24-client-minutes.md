- 11/17-01. Incorporate the client's feedback into our project from Nov.17 Meeting. **Completed**
- 11/17-02. Katrina will relay the information to our team once Shannon replies to our email. **Completed**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Do "Stand Up" from the week.

- Mention that last week's sprint consisted of working on the following tasks (the Github Project Board will briefly be shown at this time. The application will be demonstrated to highlight new features):

  - Adding description and skill selection fields to Mentee and Mentor forms.
  - Pulling matched Mentees into the Mentor UI.
  - Allowing Mentee requests to be either accepted or denied.
  - Sending a welcome email to the Mentee once the Mentee form has been filled and submitted.
  - Preparing logistics for the peer testing milestone (Class deliverable).

- Brief the client on this week's sprint plan:
  - Each member will conduct and attend two peer sessions. The findings from participants will be documented as a class deliverable.
  - The timezone width will be expanded so that it's the same as the other fields.
  - Incorporate any styling changes the client mentions.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- There were no major roadblocks in the last week. Development in the next week will be slowed as we focus on the peer testing class deliverable.
