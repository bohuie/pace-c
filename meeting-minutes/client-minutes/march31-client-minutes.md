#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Conduct "Stand Up".

- Our Github project board will be displayed to show what we're planning on accomplishing during the upcoming sprint. Due to the Easter long weekend, a report for the class isn't due until next week, and so our team has decided to mantain the tickets from last week's sprint. Although there hasn't been any major changes to the UI since the last meeting , our application will be running in case the client requests to see something.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- No major road blocks in terms of development stand out. The team is working towards wrapping up the term since next week is the last full week of classes.

3. Does the client have any expectations for handover that we should take into account?
