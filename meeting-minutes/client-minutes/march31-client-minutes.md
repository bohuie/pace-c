#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Conduct "Stand Up".

- Our Github project board will be displayed to show what we're planning on accomplishing during the upcoming sprint. Due to the Easter long weekend, a report for the class isn't due until next week, and so our team has decided to maintain the tickets from last week's sprint. Although there hasn't been any major changes to the UI since the last meeting, our application will be running in case the client requests to see something.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- No major road blocks in terms of development stand out. The team is working towards wrapping up the term since next week is the last full week of classes.

3. Does the client have any expectations for handover that we should take into account?

## Notes

Since Pace A and B's client liaisons joined the meeting a little late, the client asked what our group had worked on in the last week. The 'Manage Mentors' page was shown to display the changes that had been incorporated based on prior client feedback. The client suggested that we change the 'Request Mentor' button text to say 'Invite Mentor', but that was the only recommendation given (the client requested to view some of the other pages again, but didn't suggest any other changes). Our Github project board was also shown at this time to inform the client that we'll be completing tasks pertaining to last week's tickets.
Since the client sees the project as opensource, she thinks it would be beneficial to update the README file. If our final documentation covers most of this, we could simply link to that page in the Github so that the configuration instructions are easy to find.

Pace B's client liaison wasn't able to screenshare until later in the meeting, and so another member of their team demonstrated their application to the client. They'll be focusing on incorporating the client's feedback from last week (such as separating Admin and Mentor displays based on user type, adding at least a description field to the Mentee/Mentor forms, as well as time zones). They also hope to associate the Mentee and Mentor forms with the Admin's organization. A member of their team was having issues running the application, and so they were hoping to troubleshoot this soon.

Pace A then demonstrated their application. Their website has quite a few blank pages (such as on the accepted mentees and suggested mentees tabs), and so they're hoping to add a more descriptive placeholder until those pages are populated with data.

The client mentioned that she realizes that there's not a lot of time left until the projects are due, and so it's fine if groups aren't able to implement some features, as long as it's mentioned within the final documentation.

We confirmed that the last official client meeting will be next week (April 7th). However, if any teams have any questions, the client can schedule additional meetings.
