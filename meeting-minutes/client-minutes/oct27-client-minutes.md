# PACE GROUP C
# SIXTH CLIENT MEETING 10/27

## 27 OCTOBER 2020 / 9:00AM / VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING
- 09/29-02. When we create the form, we can create it to be static first, and then modify it to be dynamic later on. This should be completed before the first peer testing milestone. **In progress for this week's scrum.** 
    - Parts of the form (input fields for name, email, user type, availability, time, and "next" as well as "back" buttons will be worked on for the end of this week's sprint (Monday, November 2nd)

#### NEW BUSINESS
1. Do "Stand Up" from the week. 
- Discuss how the last week was spent finalizing the System Requirements and Design document. Let the client know that this is a deliverable that she will be reviewing. 
- Mention how our tech lead outlined steps for setting up our environment for the front-end and back-end (will demonstrate the basic application, if time allows). All members on our team now have this setup, and we are ready to begin working on the functional requirements. 
- Show the Github Project Board to provide an overview of this week's sprint. 
2. Discuss "Road Blocks"
- React is new to 3/4 of the members on our team, so a large task for this week is to become familiar with React. Once that has been accomplished, our first feature that we're working towards is creating a static form (displaying input fields and having inputted information sent to the database).
