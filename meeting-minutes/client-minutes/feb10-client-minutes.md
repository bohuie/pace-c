# PACE GROUP C

# SIXTEENTH CLIENT MEETING 02/10

## 10 February 2021 / 12:00PM/ VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

- 2/02-1. Update the Mentor form to have an input field to intake a link to the user's calendar for availability. Reflect this in the DB and send this link in the email to the Mentee when accepted. **Completed**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Conduct "Stand Up".

- Our Github project board will be displayed to show what we're planning on accomplishing during the upcoming sprint. The client will be reminded of the reading break which is occurring next week, as well as the peer testing sessions which are occuring the week after. Therefore, development will be slowed to accomodate for school logistics. Our application will be run to show the modifications to the Mentor form, the ability to be routed to a different display upon login based on user type, as well as how the application now renders new matches upon login, with the ability to decline mentees and not repeatedly be matched with them.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- Our focus will shift in the coming weeks in order to fulfill course requirements.

3. Katrina will mention her findings from researching the calendar to explain her decision on why restriciting to just Google Calendars should be an acceptable approach.
