# EIGTH CLIENT MEETING 11/10

## 10 NOVEMBER 2020 / 9:00AM / VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

- 11/2-01. Katrina will check-in with Eric on how the heuristic evaluation is going in preparation for Friday's lecture. **Completed**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Do "Stand Up" from the week.

- Mention that last week's sprint consisted of working on the following tasks:

  - Creating the UI for the Login Page (input fields for username and password, and buttons for "Forgot Password" and "Create Account")
  - Creating the UI for a Logged in Mentor (displaying mentees on a dashboard, having a logout button).
  - Validation of unique usernames before account creation.
  - Connecting the Login to the Backend and the Database.
  - Solidifying the availability feature on the form.
  - Adding front-end unit testing capabilities to the repo.
  - Using routing to split the form from the login system.
  - Styling the form.
  - Researching possible solutions for availability.

- Brief the client on this week's sprint plan:
  - Migrate the backend from a node server to Cloud Functions.
  - Refine the UI for a logged in mentor (display possible mentee matches with a button to accept or decline. Display the matched mentees. This includes pulling the information from our database once sample data has been setup).
  - Implement 'forgot password' functionality.
  - Build a page that the user gets redirected to upon successful form completion.
  - Send email to user to complete registration/validate their account.
  - Work on surrounding logistics for peer testing milestone.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- Explain to the client the complexity that matching based on availability entails.
  - Ask whether matching according to availability is a **must**, or if we can match solely on common skills and time-zones.
    - If the answer is yes, and the client is still partial towards a calendar UI, inform that client that a calendar time-picker will likely be used.
- Inform the client that the course requires us to conduct heuristic evaluations, so our focus will likely have to divert slightly over the next two weeks to setup for those.
