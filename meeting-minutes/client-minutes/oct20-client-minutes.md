# PACE GROUP C
# FIFTH CLIENT MEETING 10/20

## 20 OCTOBER 2020 / 9:00 (PST) / VIA ZOOM

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING
- 09/29-01. Aleks and Eric will finalize the prototype **Complete** 
- 09/29-02. When we create the form, we can create it to be static first, and then modify it to be dynamic later on. This should be completed before the first peer testing milestone. **Definitive Date will be determined once we know when we can start programming**
- 09/29-03. Team members should think of a name for the website (currently dubbed as the "Mentorship Portal"). **Complete**

#### NEW BUSINESS
1. Do "Stand Up" from the week. 
- Notify Shannon that the past week was spent finalizing the video presentation and peer reviewing the other presentations from the class.
- Screenshare our Github Project Board to display what we hope to accomplish during this week's sprint (Compile all system requirements in one document to be submitted, create a basic application to setup front-end and back-end so we can begin implementing features).
2. Discuss "Road Blocks"
- Refer to October 19th's team meeting minutes. Specifically: 
    - Confirm that we're to make our own website with our own domain address for the mentor/admin login system.  
    - Present the two options for hosting the iFrame (either publicly through email invite which links to the form hosted through the mentor/admin login system [which can only be accessed through that link]. Or, by generating the html iFrame code so that it can be embedded publicly within the organization's website) 
    - Run through the process for Signup Form Vs. Account Registration 
        - Two ways to create an account: Either directly through the form, or by selecting an organization who has publicly hosted the form, to which the user would then be redirected to that organization's signup form to create their account.
        - Admins don't have to fill out the signup form, they just register through Mentormatch as an organization and approve Mentors.
