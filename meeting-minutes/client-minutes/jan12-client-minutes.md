# TWELFTH CLIENT MEETING 01/12

## 12 JANUARY 2021 / 9:00AM / VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

- 11/10-03. The team should discuss possible ways of obtaining Mentor availability to send to an accepted Mentee, where the Mentee can then book a slot from the Mentor's available time slots. **In Progress**
- 11/10-05. Research how a react component can be generated into an iFrame tag. **In Progress**
- 12/1-01. We can proceed with changing the select dropdowns to the multiselect option. **Likely will be merged after client meeting**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Do "Stand Up" since the last meeting (Dec. 1).

- Our Github project board will be dispayed at this time to showcase our plan for the week's sprint. The application will also be run to showcase the work that was done over the break (primarily changes to formatting on the forms and UI).
  - The way the user selects skills has been modified to be a multiselect on the Mentee form. Katrina will show this to the client in comparison to the old method on the Mentor form to confirm the multiselect is in fact what the client prefers.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- Due to the final exam period and the holidays, development slowed on the application. The client will be informed that our team has to solidify a weekly meeting time, which will be finalized once we have a better understanding of our course schedules.

3. Inform the client of semester logistics.

- Reading Break is Feb. 15 - 19.
- Peer Testing sessions will occur Feb 22-26, so development might slow during that week.
- April 9 is our last day of the term.
