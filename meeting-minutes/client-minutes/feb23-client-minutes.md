# SEVENTEENTH CLIENT MEETING 02/24

## 24 February 2021 / 12:00PM / VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

N/A

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Conduct "Stand Up".

- Our Github project board will be displayed to show what we're planning on accomplishing during the upcoming sprint (this will likely consist of tasks for completing peer testing sessions and composing the report). Our application will be running at this time for the client incase there's anything that she'd like to view.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- Due to the reading break last week, development slowed. However, since the course requires us to conduct and participate in peer testing sessions, we created a plan for running those sessions and have created a video demo of the application.
  - The video demo is a deliverable that the client will be ranking.
- Conducting and participating in peer testing sessions will likely be the main focus of this week's sprint.

3. As we head into March, we're hoping to incoporate the feedback that we receive, and to finalize the application.
