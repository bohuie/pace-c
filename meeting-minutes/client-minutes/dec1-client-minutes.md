# ELEVENTH CLIENT MEETING 12/01

## 1 DECEMBER 2020 / 9:00 / VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

- 11/10-03. The team should discuss possible ways of obtaining Mentor availability to send to an accepted Mentee, where the Mentee can then book a slot from the Mentor's available time slots. **In progress**
- 11/10-05. Research how a react component can be generated into an iFrame tag. **Will be investigated**
- 11/24-01. The team should decide how they want to proceed with the Skills fields **To be finalized**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Do "Stand Up" from the week.

- Remind the client that the past week was spent on conducting and attending peer heuristic evaluation sessions. The team has to submit a document on the findings from the sessions, which is a class deliverable that's due on December 2nd. Despite this, some minor improvements were made to the application (such as resizing the time-zone field and modifying the CSS on the mentor cards). Our Github Project Board will be shown at this time to let the client know about the tasks that we hope to work on in the future (these cards are currently in the 'Backlog'). The application could potentially be run at this time to refresh the client on the state of our application.

- Brief the client on this week's sprint plan:
  - Our team is primarily focused on finalizing our Peer Testing One report, which will be submitted on Wednesday.
  - If time allows, we will work on tasks in the 'backlog'.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- There were no major roadblocks in the last week. Although we hope to continue development, this will most likely be slowed as we head into the final exam and Holiday season. To facilitate this, there are some areas that our team would like clarification on:
  - After discussing with the team on the multiselect versus 3 separate dropdowns to select skills, our team wants to confirm what the client's preference is. If the client is still partial towards the multiselect, the client will be reminded that this eliminates the weighted ranking. Likely, the matching would then be based on the number of common skills instead. If this client re-states that this trade-off is acceptable, our team will implement the multiselect as planned.
  - Can the client elaborate on their plan for email validation when it comes to verifying that Mentor's are associated to the company that they claim to be a part of?
  - Is it sufficient to have one field for the user's name, or should it be split into first and last name? It might not be necessary since we obtain the user's email and can correspond with the user via email, but we want to make sure this is acceptable with the client.

3. Brief the client on semester logistics and gage their expectations.

- December 4th is the last day of term one classes, and then Final Exams are from December 7th - December 22nd. As such, our team members will be focusing on studying and writing final exams. Development _could_ potentially still occur throughout December, but it will likely be slower.
- UBCO has extended the winter break by an extra week, so Term Two now beings on January 11th, 2021 (meaning that winter break is from December 23-January 11th).
- Confirm when the next client meeting will be held, and if there's anything not mentioned in our plans that our client would like us to work on.
