# PACE GROUP C

# NINTH CLIENT MEETING 11/17

## 17 NOVEMBER 2020 / 9:00AM / VIA GOOGLE MEETS

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

- 11/10-01. Separate the Mentee and Mentor forms. **Completed**
- 11/10-02. The team should decide whether we want to remove the time-zone dropdown and replace it with obtaining a user's location. **Completed, will be mentioned to the client**
- 11/10-03. The team should discuss possible ways of obtaining Mentor availability to send to an accepted Mentee, where the Mentee can then book a slot from the Mentor's available time slots. **In progress**
- 11/10-05. Research how a react component can be generated into an iFrame tag. **Will likely be investigated after peer testing #1 milestone**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Do "Stand Up" from the week.

- Mention that last week's sprint consisted of working on the following tasks (the Github Project Board will briefly be shown at this time. The application will likely be displayed at this time as well):

  - Adding Login functionality.
  - Implementing the 'forgot password' feature.
  - Saving the information from a submitted form into Firebase.
  - Building a completion page after registration.
  - Sending an email to a created user to validate their account after signup.
  - Creating the UI for how mentees (suggested and accepted) are displayed to the logged in Mentor.
  - Refining the UI for how a Mentor interacts with the system when logged in (React routing for various tabs).
  - Styling the login form.
  - Planning for Peer Testing

- Brief the client on this week's sprint plan:
  - Pulling mentee information into the Mentor UI.
  - Adding functionality to the 'accept' and 'decline' buttons for Mentee requests.
  - Refining both forms to include a description field, as well as skill fields, and sending that to the DB.
  - Styling the Mentor UI.
  - Sending a welcome email to Mentees after form submission.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- Follow-up on whether the client received the email from Thursday morning discussing the suggested UX flow for gaining availability, as well as if there's project budget.
- Inform the client that the course requires us to conduct heuristic evaluations, so our focus this week will be on finializing functionality by Friday. The next week will be spent conducting peer evaluations.
- A video demo of our progress will be submitted on November 25th, and that is a deliverable the client will be ranking.
