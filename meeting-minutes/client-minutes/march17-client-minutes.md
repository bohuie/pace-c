### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING

3/10-01. Remove the notification upon login stating that the user's suggested mentees have been updated. **To do**
3/10-02. Solidify a course of action regarding the GET request. **To be mentioned to client**
3/10-03. Look into the back-end security of our website. **To do**

#### NEW BUSINESS

1. Conduct "Stand Up".

- Our Github project board will be displayed to show what we're planning on accomplishing during the upcoming sprint. Our application will be run to demonstrate the changes made to the 'Manage Mentors' tab.

2. Discuss "Road Blocks"

- As we head into the final weeks of the term, lots of deadlines are coming up. The instructor has indicated that our focus should shift away from development of new features.

3. Modifying our DB for numeric parameters in the GET request instead of strings will be time-intensive, and given the limited time remaining for the project, it likely will not be possible.
