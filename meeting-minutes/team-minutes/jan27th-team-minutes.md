## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [Katrina] Things to keep in mind after Jan. 22nd's class meeting with Dr. Hui:
  - When it comes to testing, we should ask our client to determine which aspects are the most important to them. Along with our understanding of the client's priorty, our breadth of coverage for testing seems to be up to us. 
  - In regard to the Final Documentation/Report: we should write it in a way that can be understood by non-technical individuals. 
  - Our last client meeting can be on the last day of class (April 13). At that time, if we've completed all of the course deliverables, we can hand in our final report, and remind the client of the last review/ranking that is required of her. If we choose, we could potentially conduct client meetings into the exam period, but like in December, it's not required (just like a client meeting during Reading Break isn't required).
  - Ideally, we should aim to have most of the large functionality components complete by the end of Feb/beginning of March. The instructor typically recommends reserving March for final touches.
  - NOTE: my home phone started to ring as Dr. Hui was explaining this, so if there's anything that I may have misheard, please correct me.
- [Aleks] Do we want to look into other sign in options such a google or facebook? When I was looking through some of the firebase documentation I saw that we could add other sign in options (if the client/the team thinks it is a good idea)
- [Aleks] The login page's "Login to access the mentor ship" portal box is off centered when resizing the browser window size.
- [Eric] Some files are repeated somehow. Probably caused by creating testing files in an improper way.

## Detailed Notes:
### General Notes:
- Client meeting is moved to today
- Clarification about making the forms editiable
- More information on admin tasks will work will be sent on discord by JP
- make sure new links are in kebab case
- Admins are able to send an email to someone and through this email, the person who recieves this email can see the mentor form
- (Katrina will double check) When admins sign up, they fill in their information and then someone from mentormatch.com will review and decline/accept their invitation
- For now anyone can sign up as an admin
- After the user logs in, the user will be directed to a mentor
- Katrina will also write what she thinks the admin page should look like (optional)
- JP will deal with repeated files
