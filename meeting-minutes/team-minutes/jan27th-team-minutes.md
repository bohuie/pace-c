## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [Katrina] Things to keep in mind after Jan. 22nd's class meeting with Dr. Hui:
  - When it comes to testing, we should ask our client to determine which aspects are the most important to them. Along with our understanding of the client's priorty, our breadth of coverage for testing seems to be up to us. 
  - In regard to the Final Documentation/Report: we should write it in a way that can be understood by non-technical individuals. 
  - Our last client meeting can be on the last day of class (April 13). At that time, if we've completed all of the course deliverables, we can hand in our final report, and remind the client of the last review/ranking that is required of her. If we choose, we could potentially conduct client meetings into the exam period, but like in December, it's not required (just like a client meeting during Reading Break isn't required).
  - Ideally, we should aim to have most of the large functionality components complete by the end of Feb/beginning of March. The instructor typically recommends reserving March for final touches.
  - NOTE: my home phone started to ring as Dr. Hui was explaining this, so if there's anything that I may have misheard, please correct me.
- [Aleks] Do we want to look into other sign in options such a google or facebook? When I was looking through some of the firebase documentation I saw that we could add other sign in options (if the client/the team thinks it is a good idea)
