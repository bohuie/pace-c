## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [Task] Begin the 'updated test' portion of the final document (i.e see if anything from the Requirements Milestone report needs to be updated, and document any components that we haven't been able to unit test and why).
- [Katrina] Discuss how we'd like to approach the 'promo' video (I wrote the "example scenario for each user group of how they will use the software" scenarios in a way that we could use for the demo video [i.e Team members could be assigned to be an Admin, Mentor, or Mentee. Depending on the user type, read what's in the example paragraph, and screen record using the system per the description]. But, there is likely a more creative/interesting way that we could approach this).
  - I'll likely ask the instructor during Friday's meeting for clarification on her expectations of what a "clearly narrated and subtitled video" is (i.e are we expected to manually add our own subtitles, or would Youtube/equivalent software suffice?). 
- [Katrina] Discuss how we'd like to approach the presentation video (who will be presenting which slides? How did we want to present (i.e are we going to separately record our assigned slides, then compile each part into one video? Course caveat: "If we cannot see your face, at least include a picture", what's the team's preference?)
- [Katrina] Possible tasks as mentioned from the client's suggestions during March 17th's meeting:
  -  Incorporate minor modifications to the 'Manage Mentors' tab per the client's suggestions (expand the width of the columns so they each take up 50% of the window's width; move the placement of the 'Request Mentor' button/modal to the upper right corner of the 'Requested/Pending Mentors' column; and change the name of the columns so it's just one or two words without the '/' (i.e 'Pending Mentors' rather than 'Invited/Pending Mentors'.).)
  -  Prohibit Mentor Form submission unless the user was requested (i.e so only requested users can submit the form. This could likely be done by seeing if the email that was inputted onto the form matches with any email addresses for that Organization's 'pendingMentors' field in the DB).  
- [Katrina] Sprint planning pertaining to the Final Deliverable (some tasks will likely be pushed to next week's sprint):
  - Update the software-implementation-update.md file so that it's more accurate (the points listed under 'Known Bugs' are outdated. Also address the points under ["An update on the status of the software implementation"](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/bowenhui/499/finalReport.html). In other words, mention how our system meets minimum viable product requirements). 
  - Within pdf-report.md, add information under the "Technical Specifications" header.
  - Create/update the presentation slides.
  - Eliminate typos and inconsistencies from slides.
-
