## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [Task] Begin the 'updated test' portion of the final document (i.e see if anything from the Requirements Milestone report needs to be updated, and document any components that we haven't been able to unit test and why).
- [Katrina] Possible tasks as mentioned from the client's suggestions during March 17th's meeting:
  - 3/17-01. Incorporate minor modifications to the 'Manage Mentors' tab per the client's suggestions (expand the width of the columns so they each take up 50% of the window's width; move the placement of the 'Request Mentor' button/modal to the upper right corner of the 'Requested/Pending Mentors' column; and change the name of the columns so it's just one or two words without the '/' (i.e 'Pending Mentors' rather than 'Invited/Pending Mentors'.).)
  - 3/17-02. Prohibit Mentor Form submission unless the user was requested (i.e so only requested users can submit the form. This could likely be done by seeing if the email that was inputted onto the form matches with any email addresses for that Organization's 'pendingMentors' field in the DB).
