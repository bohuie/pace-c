## Detailed Notes:
- JP's Report of Q&A from Oct 16 class:
1. We can't use issues the way we have, we have to do a couple of issues per week.
2. Keep issues only to one label
3. Regarding work breakdown: we're free to do what we want

- iframe:
1. Option 1 - Email: Create account on mentor match as an admin, then the admin creates the form/iframe, and then the admin can generate a link that can be shared, and when the shared link is clicked the link will bring the user who clicked it to the mentor match website which will then show the user the iframe/form
2. Option 2 - Website Hosting: A button will generate the iframe from what the admin has inputted in the fields of the form. Admin can then generate the iframe on their own website which will then send the data to the mentor match website after the user has filled out the form. Similar to this: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started

- Signup form VS account registration:
1. As a mentor or a mentee: 
2. If I fill the form, an account is created for me. 
3. If I go directly on the mentorship portal, I have to pick an organization to sign up with (from the list of only organizations that publicly host the form [1]), otherwise I cannot create an account 

1. As an admin: 
2. I never fill out the form. I only create an account for my company, and it is accepted that I am from this company by my email address. 
3. I have to validate mentors that sign up with my organization, I do not have to validate mentees that sign up with my organization.
- Have someone above the admin, someone who can moderate the admin, this user will accept or decline admin requests

- Name for website
1. Mentormatch.

- An admin represents an organization, but organization is not a new role, it just shows what organization and admin belongs to.

- We can use GitHub project board, instead of Trello.

- Pick 10-15 questions of the best/most thoughtful questions from the evaluations, put a disclaimer to show that we did this.

- Do not make issues outside of the team sprint meetings.

## Action Items:
- Are we going to have our own website (katrina asks)
- Go over the "should we" notes with client (katrina asks)
- katrina will group the questions based on the most thoughtful questions, and then assign us questions
- aleks will do requirements document.
