## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 


## Agenda Items:
- [Katrina] B.C's Daylight Savings Time is March 14 (Sunday), so the PST time-zone will be moving ahead one hour. I'm not sure if everyone on the team is already aware of this, but since you're all in different time-zones I thought I'd mention it.
- [Katrina] Possible tasks for sprint planning:
  - Suggested by the client: Shorten the description of the 'Invite Mentor' section in Manage Mentors tab/create a modal for the email.
  - Suggested by the client: Create card components for the columns in the 'Manage Mentors' tab.
  - Clean codebase:Remove extraneous LOC, add additional comments if needed to assist with turnover to the client
-
