## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [aleks] we could make the "please verify your email" page have a design as a task (if more tasks are needed)
- [Katrina] Receive clarification on issues #394 and #393
- [Katrina] Peer testing logistic: Is everyone on the team going to participate/conduct their testing sessions with the same people as last time?

## Detailed Notes:
### General Notes:
- Ask prof if we will lose marks if we do not span the entire groups.
- Try to stay with the same person as last time for peer testing
