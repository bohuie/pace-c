## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [aleks] we could make the "please verify your email" page have a design as a task (if more tasks are needed)
- [Katrina] Receive clarification on issues #394 and #393
- [Katrina] Peer testing logistic: Is everyone on the team going to participate/conduct their testing sessions with the same people as last time?

## Detailed Notes:
### General Notes:
- Ask prof if we will lose marks if we do not span the entire groups
- Try to stay with the same person as last time for peer testing
- If you can not get the same person try to get the same group
- ~Does the mentor form link have to be connected to the company (client question)~
- Is it okay for a mentor link to be forwarded (client question)
- Do we have to make single use links (client question)
- Can we make the link available to the public for now then if needed later make it restricted (client question)
- will send prof an email about last weeks gitstats
