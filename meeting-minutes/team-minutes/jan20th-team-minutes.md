## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- Complete testing tasks for last week
- Decide on weekly meeting time if everyone knows their schedule
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [aleks] talk about midpoint feedback (if we do not already know what happened)
- [aleks] small bugs on the mentor tutorial/suggested/accepted pages (https://discord.com/channels/756399767457628171/756399768107745362/799522649273139222)
- [aleks] When the user first logins the first page the user sees is a blank page (is this supposed to be like this or should we add something to it)
- [Katrina] Get clarification on the bug that Eric mentioned on Jan 17. 
- [Katrina] Subjectively, my ranking of future issues (higher importance as indicated by the client to lower importance) are as follows: 
  -	Resolve unit testing errors 
  -	Convert Mentee Form to iFrame {already an exploration issue}
  -	Explore/finalize course of action for gaining availability {already an exploration issue}
  -	Create a matching algorithm based on number of common skills and similar timezone {already a task in the backlog}
  -	 Block user login until they have verified their account.
  Note: We will also have to keep the admin functionality in mind, but this should be fairly simple for a task later on, since it would entail creating an admin user. Their purpose would be to invite future Mentor users to access the Mentor form via email. I would therefore argue that we focus as much as possible on tackling the remaining larger functionalities of the project to ensure we meet the requirements for the minimum viable product.
- [Katrina] Can I continue making the client meetings a task?
- 

## Detailed Notes:
### General Notes:
- Midpoint feedback had a communication errror (currently waiting for a reply from the client)
- Small bugs on mentor tutorial have been fixed
- Blank page when you log in is not a bug, but in the future we will fix it (when we get closer to the finished project)
- Erics bug is reviewed (sometimes emails will take some time to come)
- It's okay to make client meetings a task
- Focus on working on bigger tasks such as converting to iFrame
- Working more on functionality rather than testing from this week onwards
- 

### Current Week Tasks:
- Resolving the unit tests
- Explore and start availability implementation
- Block users login until the verified their account
- Explore how to convert to iFrame

- Send mentee emails when they are accepted by a mentor
- Midpoint feedback problem
-
