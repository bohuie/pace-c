# Before Team Meeting Things To Do:

-

## Agenda Items:

- [Katrina] Possible tasks for this week's sprint:

1.  Update “pdf-report.md”

- Under the “Technical Specifications” header, add “A list of technical specifications that the software was built on and runs on” (https://people.ok.ubc.ca/bowenhui/499/finalReport.html)
- Update the “Limitations of MentorMatch” header to include “Limitations and Future Improvements”
  Also make a note of the following:
  - the GET request URLs are on localhost. These would need to be updated if the site is deployed
  - Prohibit Mentor Form submission unless the user was requested

2. Update “step-by-step-guide.md”

- As requested by the client, ensure that everything under the heading 'Maintenance Issues' has been written in a general way so that anyone who decides to use our codebase can create a Firebase and gmail account, as well as know what needs to be updated in our code for it to work (i.e firebase-init.js would have to be updated).
- Could likely also add that ensuring back-end security was added as a bonus feature (possibly under the 'Unimplemented Features' heading).

3.  Update software-implementation-update.md

- Under the “Updated Test Report” heading, provide a brief description of how we tested our components, and reasons/challenges for why certain components could not be tested (i.e Firebase Mocking).
- Mention that all M.V.P functionality has been delivered.
- Update the information under the “Known Bugs” header.

4.  Update the README file.

- Since the client sees the project as open source, she thinks it would be beneficial to update the README file. If our final documentation covers most of this, we could simply link to that page in the Github so that the configuration instructions are easy to find.

5. Create final video, then update links.md. Also add the final video link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e69inCHvbZp41JTyD91UJMYCS25aJB0M9EZ9rYtDdzQ/edit#gid=0)

- [Katrina] Aside (mainly thinking out loud): I was reading the 'Intro' slides from the first day of class (just because), and the 'background survey' we took was part of Jeff Bulmer's research. I wonder if we'll receive results of his study/how any sort of data collected on us will be used for that?
