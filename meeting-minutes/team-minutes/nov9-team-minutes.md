# Meeting Minutes - November 9th

## Agenda Items:
- [aleks] Will not have internet for the 23 and 30 of nov. Can we switch the meeting to Sunday
- [Eric & JP] technical decision on whether we need a cloud function instead of using server as a part of dataflow.
- [aleks] Start planning for "dry runs" of the program as per the course website, such as what we want to have done before that time.
- [aleks] What do you guys want to do about reading week, are we still going to hold a meeting?
- [JP] Suggest we do a Saturday status check: everyone writes their progress on their tasks every Saturday so we're all in the loop. 
- [JP] In the future, we need to make tasks way more descriptive to include very clear expected outcomes from whomever is working on them.
