## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- Have reviewed all of Katrina's PRs
- Be up to date on the issues we currently have outstanding, try to think of at least 2 you'd like to take care of. If there are none or not enough available, then open up the website, and try to think of things we need to do that would interest you and note them down as issues. That will make the meeting a lot faster. 
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [aleks] agree on a weekly meeting time
- [jp] Start sprint planning
- [jp] Start/Figure out how to do unit testing
- [Katrina] Provide the team with a refresher on what the client mentioned to prioritize from the Dec. 1st client meeting (First, implementing the calendar availability, and then converting the mentee form to an embedded iFrame)
-	[Katrina] After reviewing the course website, it doesn’t seem like there’s many linked items in the ‘resource’ column (which makes sense since the peer testing and video demos are things we’ve already done, so I’d assume the criteria is the same). However, during the final exam period, a ‘Final report’ is listed. I’m planning on asking the instructor about what’s expected from this, just to keep it in mind for the future and be able to chip away at if possible.
-	[Katrina] Minor health update (not a priority item, just an FYI but I don't want to forget to mention)

## Testing plan: 
- We'll start with catching up on unit testing our whole codebase. The aim is to have this done in 5 to 7 days.
- We'll share the work as follows. Each person is responsible for adding the tesing to 3 files. JP will get one file done ASAP and others can follow the example. Note that the implementation and the testing files should be moved to a new folder under the components containing both, as per JP's example.

ForgotPassword.js - JP  
Login.js - JP  
MenteeCompletion.js - Katrina
