## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [Katrina] Propose possible tasks for this week's sprint, based on client and peer testing feedback:
  - Task(s) for minor modifications to the app: Modify the 'Availability' label on the Mentor Form so the required input type is clearer (i.e 'Calendar link'); Change the placeholder of the 'Availability' field to be an example of a Google Calendar link; make the tabs an Admin sees consistent (i.e 'View Mentee Form', rather than 'Mentee Form' to match with 'View Mentor Form'.); Provide a brief description to clarify the purpose of the Mentor Form and Mentee Form tabs that an Admin interacts with; Change the wording of the 'Home' tab to say 'Mentor Match'; Remove the Mentee's email address or asterisk part of it out on the Mentee requests; Redirect Mentee users to our website after successfully filling out the mentee form.
  - Finalize the iFrame form so that it's associated with the organization.
  - Add an 'Organization' field in the DB for Mentees, and modify the matching algorithm so that it takes into account common organizations between Mentors and Mentees.
  - Add unit tests for components that we have yet to test (AdminHome, AdminSignup, LandingPage, EmailVerify, etc). 
- [Katrina] Double check on item one of Codebar's recommendation (i.e they'd like to be able to have multiple admins associated to the same organization. I'm pretty sure we're already able to do that, but I just want to be 100% certain).
