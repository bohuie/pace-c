## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 


## Agenda Items:
- [Katrina] Propose possible tasks for this week's sprint, based on client and peer testing feedback:
  - Task(s) for minor modifications to the app: Modify the 'Availability' label on the Mentor Form so the required input type is clearer (i.e 'Calendar link'); Change the placeholder of the 'Availability' field to be an example of a Google Calendar link; make the tabs an Admin sees consistent (i.e 'View Mentee Form', rather than 'Mentee Form' to match with 'View Mentor Form'.); Provide a brief description to clarify the purpose of the Mentor Form and Mentee Form tabs that an Admin interacts with; Change the wording of the 'Home' tab to say 'Mentor Match'; Remove the Mentee's email address or asterisk part of it out on the Mentee requests; Redirect Mentee users to our website after successfully filling out the mentee form.
  - Finalize the iFrame form so that it's associated with the organization.
  - Add an 'Organization' field in the DB for Mentees, and modify the matching algorithm so that it takes into account common organizations between Mentors and Mentees.
  - Add unit tests for components that we have yet to test (AdminHome, AdminSignup, LandingPage, EmailVerify, etc). 
- [Katrina] Double check on item one of Codebar's recommendation (i.e they'd like to be able to have multiple admins associated to the same organization. I'm pretty sure we're already able to do that, but I just want to be 100% certain).
- 


## Detailed Notes:
### General Notes:
- Working on unit testing
- Working on bug fixes
- Katrina will come up with unit testing issues
- Katrina is lead of unit testing
- 


### Current Week Tasks:
- Unit testing (JP)
- Correlate instances of the Mentee form with the organization so that Mentees are matched with Mentors from that organization. Add a field for organizations to Mentees in the database
- Update the matching algorithm so that organization types are considered in the matching process
- Double check on item one of Codebar's recommendation (i.e they'd like to be able to have multiple admins associated to the same organization. I'm pretty sure we're already able to do that, but I just want to be 100% certain)
- Finalizing the iFrame form so that it's associated with the right organization
- Creating matches with Mentees and Mentors from common organizations
- Unit testing (Katrina)
- Unit testing lead 
- Create unit testing issues
- Unit testing (Eric)
- Change the wording of the 'Home' tab to say 'MentorMatch'
- Redirect Mentee users to our website after successfully filling out the mentee form
- Remove the Mentee's email address or asterisk part of it out on the Mentee requests (only after a mentor accepts a mentee’s request should the mentee’s email be visible to the mentor)
- Change the title of the tab to say ‘MentorMatch’
- Unit testing (Aleks)
- Modify the 'Availability' label on the Mentor Form so the required input type is clearer (i.e 'Calendar link')
- Make the tabs an Admin sees consistent (i.e 'View Mentee Form', rather than 'Mentee Form' to match with 'View Mentor Form'.)
- Change the placeholder of the 'Availability' field to be an example of a Google Calendar link
- Provide a brief description to clarify the purpose of the Mentor Form and Mentee Form tabs that an Admin interacts with; For this one, add some text above or below each form admins and mentors see (find good spot) to explain why they are seeing this
- Change forms seen by admin and mentor to be in “showcase mode”
-
