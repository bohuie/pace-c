## Before Team Meeting Things To Do:
- 

## Agenda Items:
- [Aleks] menteeformembedder, making a test that tests the iframe.
- [Aleks] Review the file software-implementation-update's known bugs section to make sure they are up to date.
- [Aleks] I made a folder called final-deliverables that has each of the 4 documents we need according to <https://people.ok.ubc.ca/bowenhui/499/finalReport.html>. I made sections on each of the files of what needs to be done. I already wrote most of what we are able to write however, once the project is complete we will need to fill in the sections that were not yet filled in.
