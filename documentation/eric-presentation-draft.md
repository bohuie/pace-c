## Introduction ##
- Hi I'm Eric. I'm going to introduce you our project MentorMatch. 
  The system is a web-based metormatch platform for three types of users. Administrators, who can manage and request mentors according to different organizations. Mentors, who are able to teach mentees according to their abilities and menteeâ€™s needs. And Mentees, who provide the skills that they want to be mentored in as well as their personal information. Also, mentors and mentee are expected to communicate through email.

## Specifications ##
### Requirements ##
- At the beginning of the project, our team created prototypes to have a basic idea of how the workflow    will be. 
- As our client required, first, Admin users need to fill out a form that asks for names and Emails. Then, they are directed to create their own account on the website. After logging current mentees, mentors, and requests to mentors are viewable.
- For Mentors, they need to fill out the same form that will dynamically change for them. Then, after creating an account and logging in matched mentees and availbility are viewable.
- For mentees, they need to fill out the form as well. However, they are not required to create an account. Instead, they are expected to contact mentor's through email.

### Design ###
- There are some improvements and differences while developing the product.
- Admins need to create an account through the login page, and verify their newly created account through the link in their inbox. After logging in current mentors, pending mentors, and two forms provided to mentor and mentee are viewable.
- except requirements, mentors are able to accept or decline mentee's request.
- Mentee functionalties was built as required.

### Test results ###
- Here is a screenshot of unit test results and coverage.
- Most of the components are tested except parts related to firebase mocking.
