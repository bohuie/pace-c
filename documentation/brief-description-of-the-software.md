# General Description
The software we are building is to create a web-based Mentorship platform that would allow users to register as a mentor or a mentee. In addition, users from the organization using our product can register and sign in as administrators. After registering, a mentor or mentee are required to fill a mentor-ship form for identification. Then, the platform shows viewable calendar for availability of mentors from which mentees can request for a meeting, and, on their version of the site, mentors can view and manage mentees' mentorship requests. 

## Function requirement description
* Mentor
System requires mentors to create their own accounts and fill out the sign-up form in order to approve mentee's matching requests via emails. In addition, System requires mentors to provide email address and availability of their schedule for mentees to book an appointment.

* Mentee
System does not require mentees to have their own account. Instead, they are required to fill out the sign-up form in order to view availability of mentors they are going to match with. Also, they need to provide contact info while filling the form.

* Admins
TBA
