# Tasks Breakdown

1.  Update “pdf-report.md”

- Under the “Technical Specifications” header, add “A list of technical specifications that the software was built on and runs on” (https://people.ok.ubc.ca/bowenhui/499/finalReport.html) - Katrina
- Update the “Limitations of MentorMatch” header to include “Limitations and Future Improvements” - JP
  Which includes, but isn't limited to:
  - the GET request URLs are on localhost. These would need to be updated if the site is deployed
  - Prohibit Mentor Form submission unless the user was requested

2. Update “step-by-step-guide.md” - JP

- As requested by the client, ensure that everything under the heading 'Maintenance Issues' has been written in a general way so that anyone who decides to use our codebase can create a Firebase and gmail account, as well as know what needs to be updated in our code for it to work (i.e firebase-init.js would have to be updated).
- Could likely also add that ensuring back-end security was added as a bonus feature (possibly under the 'Unimplemented Features' heading).

3.  Update software-implementation-update.md - Katrina

- Under the “Updated Test Report” heading, provide a brief description of how we tested our components, and reasons/challenges for why certain components could not be tested (i.e Firebase Mocking).
- Mention that all M.V.P functionality has been delivered.
- Update the information under the “Known Bugs” header.

4.  Update the README file. - Will need to be assigned (waiting for documentation to be finished)

- Since the client sees the project as open source, she thinks it would be beneficial to update the README file. If our final documentation covers most of this, we could simply link to that page in the Github so that the configuration instructions are easy to find.

5. Create final video, then update links.md. Also add the final video link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e69inCHvbZp41JTyD91UJMYCS25aJB0M9EZ9rYtDdzQ/edit#gid=0) - JP


Step 1: Do all above assigned tasks by Wednesday April 14th
Step 2: Meet (Katrina and JP) regular meeting time on Wednesday April 14th
Step 3: Finalize readme, communicate with client for final handover
