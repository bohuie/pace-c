# How the project will be tested
## Front end
On the front-end, we want to use React, with a few librairies as well. To test our React, we will use Jest and React-testing-library. As per [this link](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html), that is the standard way of implementing testing in a React application. 

Jest is specifically aimed at testing JavaScript and, although it is not the only way to do so, it is the tool recommended by React, and it was developed by Facebook. 

React-testing-library is a good way to test React.
