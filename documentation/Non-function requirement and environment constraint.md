# Non-function requirement and environment constraint
## Efficiency  
System requires the least time/steps it will take users to perform their task such as registration and matching mentorship because the software we are building is a mentorship tool that makes mentors' and mentees' lives easier.
## Safety  
Errors that users make is undoable and should be simple to operate. (e.g. undo button)
## Utility  
System provides sufficient functionality for users to accommodate range of users tasks. For example, availability of mentor on calendar, registration, sign up form, personal account modification module, etc.(core functions)
## Testability  
System should be able to test by non-staff users to collect feedback.
## Extensibility  
System should be easily editable if a new feature is going to be added because again this should be a helpful tool and keep updating system to be more useful by users feedback if possible.
## Stability  
System should not meet any conflicts when users are tasking.
## Data reliability  
System collects users' personal infomation when accessing the software. Backend data management should be safe and stable to store personal information. (e.g. users who have registered should not be required to register again because of loss of data.)
