# Lists of tasks for the three target user groups

## Tasks as an Admin

1. View the landing page of the application. See what you can interact with as a user who isn't logged in.
2. Create an account by filling in the Organization sign-up form.
3. Notice how the 'Login' tab now changes to include part of your email address. Click on this tab.
4. View your email to see if you've received a verification email (this could be in your junk folder or inbox). Do not click this email. Instead, click the 'Resend Verification Email' button (Note: the verification email will send once a minute has passed from the first verification email being received).
5. Verify your email. Go back to our application and refresh the page. You have now successfully registered your Organization on Mentor Match, and are an Administrator for the Organization in our system.
6. On the 'Manage Mentors' tab, type your email address into the 'Mentor's Email Address' field, and and click 'Request Mentor'.
7. Verify that you receive an email, indicating that you've been invited to be a Mentor.
8. View the 'Mentee Form' tab. There are two main components within this tab: The 'Generate iFrame' button, and the Mentee Form. If you click on the button, an iFrame tag will be created. If you copy and paste this tag into the source code of a public website, the Mentee Form (as seen below the button) will be placed onto the site. This is how Mentees will register.
9. Click on the 'Mentor Form Tab'. This is where the link that requested Mentors receive in an email will be redirected. From here, Mentors can register for an account.
10. Logout.

## Tasks as a Mentor

1. Access the Mentor Form through the email link that you receive from being invited by an admin.
2. Try to register with the same email address that you used to become an admin. Notice how this results in a popup, requiring you to provide a different email address.
3. Provide a link to any website (for example: https://www.ubc.ca/) in the 'Availability' input field. Notice how this is not an accepted format. Try a Google Calendar link instead (https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZGZ1a24wN2M4M21zaGRqNGg5NzhjZ2l0aWtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).
4. Once the form has been submitted successfully, verify your email.
5. Navigate to your account by clicking on the tab with part of your email address in it, and view what a logged in Mentor sees.
6. Go to the 'Suggested Mentee' tab.
7. Decline a Mentee, making note of their name.
8. Logout.
9. Login.
10. Go the 'Suggested Mentee' tab again, and notice how the Mentee you declined is no longer recommended.
11. Accept a Mentee.
12. Navigate to the 'Accepted Mentee' tab. See how the user that you've accepted is now in this tab.
13. Logout.
14. When a Mentee requests a meeting during an available timeslot, reflect that the time they've requested is no longer available for other Mentees.

## Tasks as a Mentee

**Please note:** To save time (since some tasks may take longer than estimated), testers will not be required to register using the Mentee form. This is because we're using many of the same testers as the first peer testing session.

1. View the email that will be received once a Mentor accepts your request.
2. Notice how the Mentor's email address is within that email, and you can now correspond with that Mentor by using their email address.
3. View the Google Calendar link (https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZGZ1a24wN2M4M21zaGRqNGg5NzhjZ2l0aWtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) and look at the times that the Mentor is available.
4. Let the Mentor know that you wish to meet with them during one of the timeslots that they're available (either by emailing them directly, or using the Google Calendar email feature (i.e by clicking on the envelope)).
