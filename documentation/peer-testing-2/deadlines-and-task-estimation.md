# Deadlines for Peer Testing

**February 15th:**

- All team members will spend some time testing the application. If any bugs are found, they can be documented in the 'known-bug.md' in the 'minor-improvements-and-bug-report' branch. Updates to fix and/or improve the state of the application can also be pushed to this branch, which will be reviewed to be merged.
  - All development intended for the peer testing milestone should be complete by this date. This means that: The application is running as expected, and all features have been merged into the Develop branch by 11:59PM (PST).

**February 23rd:**

- As indicated by Aleks, he should be able to record the video demo of the application around the 20th/21st of February. Ideally, we should submit the video link by the 23rd at the latest to ensure everything is ready in case there's anything unexpected that we need to fix.

**February 26th:**

- Ideally, each member of the team will have conducted both of their peer testing sessions by 11:59PM (PST) on Friday, February 26th. This will leave a couple of days to compose the report.

**March 1st:**

- Similar to the last peer testing milestone, Katrina has uploaded a markdown file that is formatted [per the Peer Testing Report Expectations](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/bowenhui/499/peertesting.html) criteria.
  - Each team member is to modify this file in a separate branch, creating a PR once the findings from conducting their peer testing sessions have been added.
  - It is up to each team member’s discretion whether an item is ranked as high, medium, or low priority. However, this might be modified after being reviewed.

**March 2nd:**

- The markdown file should be finalized, converted into a PDF, and submitted onto Canvas by March 2nd at 11:59pm. (NOTE: The assignment is due the morning of March 3rd, but we should aim to have it submitted the night before it’s due).
- Each team member should create a Peer Evaluation for each other through the course’s evaluation website.

## Before conducting the peer session\*\*:

- According to the course website: Each session should last 50 minutes in total (where 40 of those minutes are used for the participant to complete tasks)
  - Since we were all able to successfully conduct the first peer testing milestone, we should have the necessary software already installed. Before your first peer testing session, ensure that you're familiar with the platforms you're using (i.e Zoom, how to screen record, etc.).
  - Ensure the app is running before the participant attends the session (**NOTE** Remeber to have both the front-end and back-end running at this time. For a refresher on how to do this, see the 'setup.md' file in the 'tech-directives' folder).
  - Similar to the first peer testing sessions, the remote control users won’t be able to access their email’s inbox from their own laptop (unless they log into their account via your device). As such, each team member should communicate with the participant beforehand to ensure that they will have access to their email address via their phone during the session so that they can view the confirmation email(s).
    - Like last time, Katrina will organize screenshots of the emails that users can expect to receive. This will be sent in a Discord announcement.

## Estimated Task Breakdown for Peer Evaluations:

| Estimated Time | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| ~ 1 Minute     | Familiarize the user on our application by displaying the landing page. This should provide a sufficient introduction to the user types as well as how the user interacts with the system. Explicitly mention that Mentees access the Mentee Form through an Organization's website (not directly through our application). Mentors access the Mentor Form through our application, but only when they have been invited by admins. Only Mentors and Admins are required to have an account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ~ 30 Seconds   | Let the user describe what they see on the application, and what they think they can interact with. Have them navigate to the 'Login' tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ~ 30 Seconds   | Once on the Login page, ask the user what they think clicking on the 'Create Account' button does (hopefully, they'll remember that only Admins and Mentors need to have an account. Mentors can only signup through the Mentor form, which an Admin sends. So, the 'Create Account' button should route them to a page where Admins register).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ~ 1.5 Minutes  | Have the user register as an Admin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ~ 2.5 Minutes  | Have the user navigate to their account by clicking on the former 'login' tab (now replaced by part of their email address). **PLEASE NOTE:** Verification emails can only be sent one minute after each other. As such, if the user navigates to their account, sees the 'EmailVerify' page, and clicks the 'Resend Verification Email' button **it will NOT send another verification email until one minute has passed**. Therefore, explain to the user that the pop-up they receive is accurate. Get the user to verify that they received the first verification email in their inbox, but don't have them click it. Once a minute has passed since the initial verification email was sent, have them click the 'Resend Verification Email' button. Make sure they've received a second email, and get them to click that email. Once they've verified their email, get them to refresh the page. |
| ~ 1 Minute     | Now that the user has successfully registered as an admin, by default, they'll be on the 'Manage Mentors' tab. Get them to request a Mentor by having them enter their email address into the input field. (Yes, they'll essentially be requesting themselves has a mentor). Get them to check their email to make sure Admins can request Mentors (explain to the tester that since our website hasn't been deployed, the link won't route them to the Mentor Form. However, we'll test registering as a Mentor later).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ~ 2 Minutes    | Ask the user what else they think they can do as a logged in admin. This should prompt them to explore the 'Mentee Form' and 'Mentor Form' tabs. Explain to them that the 'Mentor Form' tab is where requested mentors will be routed to when they click the link in the email. Don't have them register as a Mentor yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ~ 1 Minute     | Once the user goes to the 'Mentee Form' tab, get them to click on the 'Genterate iFrame' button. Explain to them that as an Admin, they could take this iFrame tag to embed on their organization's website. From there, whoever comes across the public form can register as a Mentee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ~ 15 seconds   | Get the user to logout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ~ 4 minutes    | Have the user register as a Mentor using the same email address that they used to register as an Admin. Notice how this prevents the form from being submitted. Either delete the email that the tester used to register as an Admin from the Authentication tab in Firebase, OR use an account that you have the credentials for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ~ 1 minutes    | In the zoom chat, send a link other than a Google Calendar link to demonstrate how only Google Calendar links will be accepted (for ex. https://www.ubc.ca/ ). Provide the tester with a [Google Calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZGZ1a24wN2M4M21zaGRqNGg5NzhjZ2l0aWtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) so that the Mentor form can be filled in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ~ 2 minutes    | Get the user to verify their email (this part might unnecessary if you're using an account that you have the credentials for instead). Once the tester is viewing what a logged in Mentor sees, ask them what's different from what an Admin can view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ~ 1 minute     | Have the user decline a Mentee request, and make note of that name. Have the user logout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ~ 1.5 minutes  | Get the user to login again, and go to the 'Suggested Mentees' tab. Ensure that the user they've declined is no longer being suggested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ~ 1 minute     | Have the user accept a Mentee request. Make sure the request that they've accepted is reflected in the 'Accepted Mentees' tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ~ 2 minutes    | Describe to the user that once a Mentor has accepted a Mentee request, the Mentee will receive an email. Show the tester a screenshot of the email that the Mentee receives, pointing out that the Mentor's skills, email, calendar link, and description are sent to the accepted Mentee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ~ 5 minutes    | Go to the Google Calendar link. Describe how the Mentee could request a time reflected in the Mentor's calendar, and how the Mentor would then manage the calendar to update their availability. Explain how communication between Mentors and Mentees occurs through email (i.e externally from our application).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Please note:** The current task estimation is currently ~28 minutes. Depending on the tester, completing the tasks might take significantly longer, or significantly shorter.
