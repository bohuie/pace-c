# Deadlines for Peer Testing

**November 18th:**

- The team will hold a meeting on Wednesday, November 18th at 7AM (PST). This will be to primarily ensure that the team is up to date on the content within this document, so that we all follow a similar methodology when conducting our peer testing sessions.

**November 20th:**

- As indicated on the course website, Friday’s lecture on November 20th will introduce “how sign-up works”. After this date, all members of our team _should_ know when we’re taking part in another group’s peer testing, as well as when we’re conducting our own.**If possible, we should aim to have both our remote and think aloud sessions completed by November 27th**
- All development intended for the peer testing milestone should be complete by **7pm(PST) on November 20th**. This means that: The application is running as expected, and all features have been merged into the Develop branch.
- Hopefully, after Friday’s lecture, we should have a better understanding of what the ‘Video Demo’ (due on November 25th) entails. Depending on the instructor’s expectations, one member of the team might be able to film a demonstration of the application for the client, or this task will be broken down further if all members are required to talk for a certain amount of time.

**November 25th:**

- A video demonstration of our application will be submitted. Details TBD

**November 27th:**

- Ideally, each member of the team will have conducted both of their peer testing sessions by 11:59PM (PST) on Friday, November 27th.

**November 30th:**

- Once the peer testing sessions have been completed, each team member needs to compile the results of their testing into a report. For the sake of simplicity, Katrina will upload a markdown file to Github so that the file is formatted [per the Peer Testing Report Expectations](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/bowenhui/499/peertesting.html) criteria.
- To ensure each member’s work has been reviewed, a separate branch can be created to upload the findings from the peer testing sessions onto the initial formatted document [i.e Merge from Develop, create a branch to work off of, upload the findings from both peer testing sessions onto ____, create a PR when done].
  - It is up to each team member’s discretion whether an item is ranked as high, medium, or low priority. However, this might be modified after being reviewed.

**December 1st:**

- The markdown file should be finalized, converted into a PDF, and submitted onto Canvas by December 1st at 11:59pm. (NOTE: The assignment is due the morning of December 2nd, but we should aim to have it submitted the night before it’s due).
- Each team member should create a Peer Evaluation for each other through the course’s evaluation website.

## Before conducting the peer session\*\*:

- According to the course website: Each session should last 50 minutes in total (where 40 of those minutes are used for the participant to complete tasks)
  - Ensure that Zoom has been installed, and that users are able to connect remotely.
  - Run our application as if you are conducting a peer evaluation (ideally, this should be done before conducting peer testing to find and resolve any bugs).
    - Ensure the app is running before the participant attends the session.
  - Due to the remote session, users won’t be able to access their email’s inbox from their own laptop (unless they log into their account via your device). As such, each team member should communicate with the participant beforehand to ensure that they will have access to their email address via their phone during the session so that they can view the confirmation email(s).
    - On Mac, Screenshots can be dragged and dropped into the browser. Have the screenshot (an example of this will be in the comment of the PR. I haven't been able to upload a screenshot to this document directly) in a tab. This can be opened once the user is checking their phone, so that you can confirm that they received the same email as presented in the screenshot.

## Estimated Task Breakdown for Peer Evaluations:

- Reminder: The tasks participants are to complete are the same for a remote vs thinkaloud experiment. The current task allocation in the table below equates to 50 minutes.

| Estimated Time | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| ~5-10 Minutes  | - Greet the participant. - Provide a high-level description of our project (i.e Our project is to create a platform where individuals seeking mentorship can be matched with a mentor. As such, there are two user groups: a Mentee and a Mentor. During the peer testing, the participant will test out the system as both a mentee and a mentor. Mentees register through a form, and wait to be matched to a Mentor. Mentors also provide their information on a form, but they are required to have an account in our system to approve/deny mentee requests).. - In the case of the remote peer evaluation, [provide remote access](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control) |
|   2 Minutes    | - Open the browser window that the application is in (which should be running before the session begins). - Inform the user that they'll first be piloting through the system as a Mentor. - Let them know that the first step to becoming a Mentor is filling out the registration form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   5 Minutes    | - Once the user has successfully found the Mentor Form, get them to describe what they see (i.e Does it look like any fields are required? What if you submit without filling in those fields? Is the error message helpful?) - Once all the fields have been filled out correctly, ask if there's anything that the user would change. - Have the participant click the 'submit' button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  ~ 3 Minutes   | - The user should now have been redirected to the MentorCompletion component. - Have the user open their email's inbox from their phone. Confirm that they've received the email as displayed in the tab's screenshot. - Make sure the user clicks on the link in the email to verify their account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  ~ 2 Minutes   | - The user should now navigate to the Login page to enter their credentials. Similar to above, get the user to click "Login" before entering their credentials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  ~ 1 Minutes   | - Once logged in, let the user explain what they see. They should be viewing the "Tutorial"/"Mentor Home" page. Let them read the steps that are outlined, and observe that 3 tabs exists (Tutorial, Suggested Mentees, and Approved Mentees).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  ~ 5 Minutes   | - Tell the user that you want them to see which mentees are being suggested for them to Mentor. - After going to the "Suggested Mentees" tab, they should see a list of mentee cards. - Have the user accept a mentee, keeping note of that Mentee's name. - Have the user decline a mentee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  ~ 2 minutes   | - Tell the user that you now want them to see a list of their current mentees. - Once they go to the "Approved Mentees" tab, they should see the mentee that they just accepted in the earlier task. - Have the user logout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  ~ 5 Minutes   | - Get the user to reset their password.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  ~ 3 Minutes   | - Now tell the user that you want them to be a Mentee. Mentees are required to register through the Mentee Form. - Go through a similar process as when the participant was filling out the Mentor Form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  ~ 3 Minutes   | - Get the user to check their inbox to ensure that they have received an email to inform them of their Mentee registration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
