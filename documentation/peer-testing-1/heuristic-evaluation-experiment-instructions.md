# Heuristic evaluation experiment instructions #
- Heuristic evaluation is a thorough assessment of a product's user interface, and its purpose is to detect usability issues that may occur when users interact with a product, and identify ways to resolve them.

## 10 User Interface Design Heuristics ##
1. **Visibility of system status.** system status should be displayed when operations are executed like a toast message. For example, When a button is onclicked, a toast message or any other forms of message should tell user what button they are clicking on.
2. **Match between system and the real world.** System should be designed using such as icons, languages, syntax from real world. For example, Icons like calendars should be a real mini-calendar image to indicate that by clicking this icon a calandar will be displayed.
3. **User control and freedom.** System are avaliable to be undoable or redoable. For example, 'back' buttons and 'undo' buttons.
4. **Consistency and standards.** UI designers should make sure that staffs such as frames, icons, and font under the similar or even the same categories should be consistent.
5. **Error prevention.** Technical problems should not occur during User operations. Eliminating or flagging actions that may result in errors are two possible means of achieving error prevention.
6. **Recognition rather than recall.** UI designers should minimize the use of user's memory when they are guided to use the system. Recognizing something is always easier than recall because recognition involves perceiving cues that help us reach into our vast memory. For example, in some shopping website, there is a recently-viewed list to help users remind what they are interested in.
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use.** System should be designed as for all the user groups rather than explicitly assuming that all the users are experienced. For example, for novice users, they can use function through tool bar on the top of the window. However, for experienced users, they can use shortcut keys.
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design.** System should minimize the unwanted things and try to grab user's attention on the main function of each interface.
In short, Designers should build the system as simple as possible.
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors.** Designers should assume users are unable to understand technical terminology, therefore, error messages should almost always be expressed in plain language to ensure nothing gets lost in translation. For example, when users are trying to log in to the system, there should be a forgot-password link for users to recover their account.
10. **Help and documentation.** All the basic information such as the introduction and purpose of the software, FAQ section,should be displayed in an interface such as help center. The help page is neccesary even if the system is simple to understand. It helps user experience be better.

## How to Conduct our Heuristic Evaluation ##
1. **Establish an appropriate list of heuristics** according to the list above.
2. **Select your evaluators.(3-5 evaluators)** Evaluators should be carefully chosen. Importantly, they are not the users who are going to use the software when it is publicized. They should typically be usability experts and with domain expertise in the industry type that your product is in. The evaluators should have basic understanding of the system and the related knowledge in the field.
3. **Brief your evaluators** so they know exactly what they are meant to do and cover during their evaluation. The brief session is like a instruction for evaluators to follow and what will be tested and what sections they need to focus on. The briefing session should be standardized to ensure the evaluators receive the same instructions; otherwise you may bias their evaluation. In order to trach each evaluator, we can list the all the sections that needs to be tested and let them choose the one they have experience on and are interested in.
4. **First evaluation phase.** The first evaluation generally takes around two hours, depending on the nature and complexity of your product. The evaluators will use the product freely to gain a feel for the methods of interaction and the scope. **They will then identify specific elements that they want to evaluate,** which should be documented.
5. **Second evaluation phase.** In the second evaluation phase, the evaluators will carry out another run-through. They will **apply the chosen heuristics to the elements identified during the first phase.** The evaluators would focus on individual elements and look at how well they fit in the overall design.
6. **Record problems.** The evaluators must either record problems themselves or you should record them as they carry out their various tasks to track any problems they encounter. Be sure to ask the evaluators to be as detailed and specific as possible when recording problems.
7. **Debriefing session.** This session asks evaluators to discuss and share feedbacks, and a list of problems should be conducted by them. In addtion, they need brainstorm some possible solutions for these problems.
