# Potential Tasks for Jan 27 - Feb 3 Sprint

1. We'll need to set up a user type of Admin in the DB. Admins should have the following properties: Organization, Name, email address, and password. We'll likely need to use the UID to identify the organization so that when it's embedded on the organization's website, we can link that instance of the iFrame back to the organization. There might be a more efficient way to go about this though.

2. Create the sign up form for organizations/admins. We only need to ensure that the email address is unique (i.e we don't have to worry about duplicate organizations/verifying that the domain name of the email is associated to that organization).

3. Add some styling to the 'Home' page and incorporate the client's feedback (can be found in my meeting minutes).

# Tasks for Future Sprints

1. Depending on the user type who logs in, modify what's displayed (i.e for Mentors, display what we currently have. If it's an admin, display the page for admins similar to what I outlined in my userflow diagram for a logged in admin).
