# Presentation Slides for the Video Presentation 

The link to the Google Slides presentation can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J-YWpXIbMwDHzXMvHG_0DMvefQRu-bLdmC33u16-SGM/edit?usp=sharing

These slides will be submitted as part of the "Requirements and Design Milestone", which is due on October 14th. Therefore, 
- Each team member should create slides on the Google Slides link above that pertain to what they are presenting (refer to "video-instructions.md" if unsure of what you have been assigned to present). 
    - Make a note on the bottom of each slide to outline roughly what will be happening during the video at that time (i.e Approximately what you will be saying, any animations, etc.) 
- Once the slides have been created, they can be exported from Google Slides to PowerPoint. For simplicity, remove the slides that you will not be presenting. From there, audio can be recorded for the slides that the team member has been assigned to. This can easily be exported from PowerPoint to a movie format. 


| Slide |      Task   |  Team Member |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Project Description|  A basic slide has already been created on the Google Slides Presentation. Add the information that has been created for the high-level description to that slide. | Eric |
| DFD Level0 |    An image of the DFD level0 diagram will be displayed on the slide. Katrina will create an animation to highlight some of the information.     | Katrina |
| DFD Level1 | Once DFD Level1 has been completed, Katrina will import the image into a new slide, and create the surrounding dialogue, ensuring to briefly mention how the milestones will be incoporated to highlight iterative and incremental processes. |  Katrina |
| Functional Requirements - Peer Testing #1 | In bullet points, the information from "requirements-v1.md" under the  heading "Peer Testing #1" should be displayed on the screen. It might be helpful to allow this to be on half of the slide, so an image of the prototype aligning to the bulletpoint can be on the other side of the slide. This can be duplicated across however many slides are necessary, so that the image of the prototype changes to highlight the necessary functional requirement, and to reduce how many words are on one slide. **NOTE:** *Two slides of this have been added to the Google Slides presentation as an example to help visualize. However, if there's a better way to do this, please feel free to modify how the functional requirements/prototype are presented*|  Aleks |
| Functional Requirements - Peer Testing #2 | Similar to the process described above. The information to be displayed on the screen can be found from "requirements-v1.md" under the heading "Peer Testing #2" **The prototype may need to be modified to reflect the system requirements outlined in "requirements-v1.md"** |    Aleks |
| Functional Requirements - Final Report | Bullet points can be displayed on the screen from "requirements-v1.md" under the heading "Final Report". |    Eric |
| Non-functional Requirements | The slide can contain key points from the non-functional requirements document. Styling can be applied to the slide to faciliate aesthetics where neccessary.  |    Eric |
| Tech Stack - Pros & Cons | A chart can be displayed to highlight the tech stack that has been considered.|    JP |
| Tech Stack - Decision | Key points highlighting the rationale for the chosen tech stack can be displayed on the slide. |    JP |
| Testing Plan | This will most likely be split into multiple slides, depending on how much information is needed. Try to limit how many words are on the slides, and include any visuals if possible/neccessary. |    JP |
