# PACE GROUP C
# THIRD CLIENT MEETING 10/6

## 6 OCTOBER 2020 / 9:00 AM (PST) / VIA ZOOM

### AGENDA

#### BUSINESS FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING
- 09/29-01. Aleks and Eric will the modify the prototype to incorporate the following changes:
    - Instead of the skills being a checkbox, make it a ranking system. 
    - On the mentorship portal, ensure that thereâ€™s options to login, create an account, and register an organization (which also entails that the user creates an account to become an admin). 
        - Show the UI for each of those pages. 
    - This should be done by the end of the Scrum Sprint. **In progress** 
- 09/29-02. When we create the form, we can create it to be static first, and then modify it to be dynamic later on. This should be completed before the first peer testing milestone. **Definitive Date will be determined once we know when we can start programming**
- 09/29-03. Team members should think of a name for the website (currently dubbed as the "Mentorship Portal"). **In progress. Should be completed by October 12**

#### NEW BUSINESS
1. Confirm logistics surrounding the "Mentorship Portal"
    - How do mentees and mentors communicate (i.e via email or some other method)?
    - When mentees and mentors are matched, what exactly does this mean?
        - Is matching based on events being held sufficient (so one mentor to many mentees for that event), or is "matching" like a one-to-one request, where a mentee requests a mentor, and the mentor approves?
